/**
 * These are example tests of {@link com.jraska.falcon.Falcon} usage in tests on its own

 * <p/>
 * Old naming convention with tests starting on test- prefix is used,
 * because unfortunately AndroidJunit4 needs at least one method with this prefix
 * to run other JUnit 4 annotated methods.
 * <p/>
 * The code of tests is similar, but is kept separated for easier understanding.
